# My Test README

This is a test repository, used to introduce myself to Git and Github.

## Markdown

This README file supports Markdown syntax and so I can create
section headers using the '#' symbol followed by a title, on its own line.

## Contents

This repository should contain the following folders/files:
- Project.py
- test_project.py

The `test_Project.py` file contains all the tests.
The `Project.py` file contains the main python application.
